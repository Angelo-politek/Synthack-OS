# fx3

A **third send effect** next to delay and reverb: **chorus**, **flanger**, **phaser** or **crusher**.

## Use

- **SND3**: every audio track, **AMP page 2**, slot E (under DEL/REV of page 1). Saved per track with the kit, p-lockable, shown in dB like the other sends.
- **FX3 page**: FX track → **REVERB** tab, press it again for page 2. TYPE picks the effect; the next five knobs change name and range with it:

| TYPE | B | C | D | E | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHOR | SPD 0.05 … 10 Hz | DEP 0 … 8 ms | TIME 1 … 30 ms | FDBK 0 … 90 % | WID 0 … 180° (L/R LFO phase) |
| FLNG | SPD 0.02 … 5 Hz | DEP 0 … 4 ms | TIME 0.1 … 8 ms | FDBK −95 … +95 % | WID 0 … 180° |
| PHSR | SPD 0.02 … 5 Hz | DEP 0 … 6 oct | FREQ 100 Hz … 4 kHz | FDBK −90 … +90 % | WID 0 … 100 % |
| CRSH | SRR 24 kHz … 750 Hz | BITS 16 … 1 | DRV 0 … 24 dB | – | – |

- **DEL**: FX3 → delay send (the effect goes into the delay, and on to the reverb if the delay sends there). **VOL**: return level, independent of delay and reverb.
- FLNG and PHSR feedback is bipolar: centre = none. PHSR is four allpass stages; WID turns the right side into the complementary response (notches where the left has peaks). CRSH is mono.
- The return goes to the direct bus (like delay and reverb with *FX Routing* off).
- **Saved with the kit** (per pattern, like delay and reverb): in four words of the pattern kit the OS never uses (internal ids 0, 0x1A, 0x38 = hidden id 144, 0x46), one byte per knob. Older projects load with the default values.

## How it works

- **Send gains:** a hook in the per-track loop of the mix function (`0x4008F3A0`) reads SND3 from the engine copy of the track (word +106) and the track's level/pan gain, like the OS does for DEL/REV, mute included. With SND3 at 0 it returns after a few instructions.
- **Bus 3, effect and return** run after the master sums (`0x4008FB04`), at **24 kHz**: each pair of samples is averaged into the mono bus (EMAC, one pass over the sending tracks), then the effect, and the return is brought back to 48 kHz by linear interpolation while it is added to `0x8000DAD0`. The band ends around 11 kHz, like a BBD chorus.
- **Chorus / flanger**: one modulated delay line with two interpolated taps (L/R). A sudden TIME change glides (at most 8 samples per block), so the taps never jump.
- **DEL send:** the chorus output of the previous block goes into the delay bus right before the delay (`0x4008F828`), 0.67 ms later.
- **Cost** (instructions per 32-sample block, emulator, one track sending): CHOR ~1 300, FLNG ~1 500, PHSR ~1 700, CRSH ~850; ~60 idle; ~2 300 worst case (12 tracks, feedback, DEL). Nothing runs without sends, with VOL and DEL at 0, or once the inputs are silent (sequencer stopped) and the tail has died out. The OS already uses ~89 % of the CPU at rest, so this matters: see [docs/audio-path.md](../../docs/audio-path.md#cpu-load).
- **UI:** page 25 (unused "OB8" page) becomes REVERB page 2; the DELAY/REVERB tab is told to draw it as 8 plain slots. Controls are hidden ids 246–253 (Digitakt MIDI-track parameters) via [vparams](../vparams); their names are RAM strings rewritten when TYPE changes. The AMP tab is patched to give SND3 its own graphic (delay-send icon).
- Needs id 72 free: [master-comp](../master-comp) ATK moved to id 122.

## Build / test

```sh
python mods/fx3/make_patch.py
```

Test: `tests/test_fx3.py` (send gains like the OS, mute, bus sums, chorus as a pure delay, reads inside the line with sudden TIME changes, phaser and crusher against bit-exact models, return interpolation, sign and saturation, send to delay, idle after heavy use and with silent inputs, cost per block and per type, kit storage and pattern change, names and texts per type, page and drawing hooks).
